# Graph Correlation: A Parallel Between the Spectral Radius Method and a Graph Neural Network Model  

## Description  
This repository contains the source code for the thesis **"Graph Correlation: A Parallel Between the Spectral Radius Method and a Graph Neural Network Model"**. The work explores the comparison between the Spectral Radius method and a Graph Neural Network (GNN-Siamese) approach for graph correlation analysis.  

## Setup  
The source code can be executed using Jupyter Notebook files included in the repository.

## GitHub reference repos
Some code were based on https://github.com/dcuoliveira/graph-corr-embedd
